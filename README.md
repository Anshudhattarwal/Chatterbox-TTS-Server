## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anshudhattarwal/Chatterbox-TTS-Server.git
   cd Chatterbox-TTS-Server
   ```

   Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   Start the server with:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Web UI**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can use the Web UI to interact with the TTS model. You can input text, select a voice, and generate audio files. 

### Example Request
To use the API, send a POST request to the `/synthesize` endpoint with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "text": "Hello, welcome to Chatterbox TTS!",
  "voice": "default"
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Synthesize

- **Endpoint**: `/synthesize`
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**:
  - `text`: The text you want to convert to speech.
  - `voice`: The voice you want to use (optional).

### List Voices

- **Endpoint**: `/voices`
- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Returns a list of available voices.

### Voice Cloning

- **Endpoint**: `/clone`
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**:
  - `voice_sample`: Audio sample for cloning.
  
## Predefined Voices

Chatterbox TTS comes with several predefined voices. You can list these voices using the `/voices` endpoint. Each voice has its unique characteristics, allowing you to choose the best fit for your application.

## Voice Cloning

Voice cloning allows you to create a personalized voice profile. To clone a voice, provide an audio sample to the `/clone` endpoint. The server will process the sample and create a new voice profile that you can use in your TTS requests.

## Large Text Processing

The server can handle large texts efficiently. If your input text exceeds a certain length, the server will automatically split it into manageable chunks. This ensures smooth processing without losing any content.

## Execution Options

You can run the Chatterbox TTS Server on both GPU and CPU. If you have a compatible GPU, the server will utilize it for faster processing. If not, it will fall back to CPU execution. 

### Configuration

To configure the execution options, edit the `config.json` file in the root directory. You can specify the following settings:

```json
{
  "use_gpu": true,
  "max_text_length": 5000
}
```
